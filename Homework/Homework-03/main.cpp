// Hi Professor, you will see a LOT of notes in this code file. This is because I've been struggling to keep up so
// as im learning how to code im trying to be able to *EXPLAIN* how it works so it can stick in my brain. 

#include <iostream>
// This allows us to use inputs and outputs (stands for Input Output Stream)

#include <string>
// This allows us to use the strings (a line of characters)

using namespace std;
// This allows us to use the standard library without having to type "std::" before every command
